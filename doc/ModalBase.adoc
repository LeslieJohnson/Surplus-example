[[modalbase.js]]
== ModalBase.js

This serves as an anchor or placeholder for displaying `Modal`. It hides
the modal initially by setting the `displayModal` function, which is
used by the modalâ€™s CSS display style property.

It creates a `Modal` child component, and sets several properties before
returning it. The `tabIndex` property and `focus` function probably are
not needed.

The `node.style.width` and `node.style.display` properties are set to
`S.data()` streams so they will be updated automatically with their
state changes.
