[[news.js]]
== News.js

Displays a list of newsworthy items as clickable text. All of the real
work is done by `Listings`.

Identical to `Events.js` except for some string content.

The news items come from `newsStrings.js`, which is manually edited for
updated content along with matching text content files.
