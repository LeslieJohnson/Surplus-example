[[modal.js]]
== Modal.js

There are several `S.data()` streams and CSS classes used by this
component.

The obviously named `close` function uses the S stream `displayModal`
from `ModalBase`, which sets the modal’s CSS display style to ‘none’.

The `modalTitle` and `modalMsg` data streams are initially empty, to be
filled in by the `Listings` and `MenuItem` components when invoked.

The `modalTitle` div element has the Unicode ‘X’ close button and the
title for this modal.

There is a placeholder for a footer which is currently unused.
