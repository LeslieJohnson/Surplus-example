== Events.js

Displays a list of event items as clickable text. All of the real work
is done by `Listings`.

NOTE: These are social Events like dinners, not DOM events or the like.

Identical to `News.js` except for string content.

The event items come from `eventsStrings.js`, which is manually edited
for updated content along with matching text content files.
