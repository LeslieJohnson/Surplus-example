== Dropdown.js

`TopNav` uses this for creating a list of dropdown menus in its menubar.

The text label is passed in from `TopNav` as `props.name`.

Any number of children are passed from `TopNav` as `content` nodes. Each
child becomes a `MenuItem`.

Each content node is a `props.textContent` string that is passed to
`MenuItem`. `MenuItem` uses the string both as a property key from
`labeledText` to get a label, and as a file name for the modal text
content. See `MenuItem` for details.

A clicked menu item displays a `Modal`, and Modal width is passed as
`props.size`. This width will be overridden for small screens like
mobile devices.
